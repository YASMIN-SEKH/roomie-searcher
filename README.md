RoomieSearcher is a user-friendly program designed to help students in finding compatible roommates. 
The process of roommate selection is employed by an algorithm that matches individuals based on their preferences and habits. 
Students start by creating profiles and answering a set of questions regarding their living preferences. 
The algorithm then evaluates these preferences and identifies the most compatible roommates among applicants.
